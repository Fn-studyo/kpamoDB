<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Pamo was just a simple idea created to use in a minimal project like a user todo application, a check list....
Where developers don't have to import a heavy database system (mongodb, sql) into their projects, it's prettier easy to set up

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section.
* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk)
